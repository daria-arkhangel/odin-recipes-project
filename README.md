# Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to create a simple recipe website to practice basic HTML and Git. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to:

- Set up and use Git for version control
- Create HTML pages and link them together
- Use GitHub to store and share code
- Use VSCode as main text editor
