    <h4><strong>Description:</strong></h4>
        <p>
            A classic Italian pasta dish, carbonara is loved for its creamy, rich sauce made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper. Simple yet incredibly flavorful, this Roman specialty is a quick and satisfying meal. The secret to a great carbonara lies in using high-quality ingredients and timing â€“ the sauce should coat the pasta without turning into scrambled eggs.
