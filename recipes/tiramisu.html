    <h4><strong>Description:</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Tiramisu, meaning “pick-me-up” in Italian, is a classic Italian dessert known for its layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, creamy mascarpone filling, and a dusting of cocoa powder. This no-bake treat is both light and indulgent, with hints of coffee and cocoa complemented by the rich, silky mascarpone. It’s the perfect way to end an Italian meal.

            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups strong brewed espresso, cooled</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional) </li>
            <li>1 pack of ladyfinger cookies</li>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting</li>
            <li>Dark chocolate shavings for garnish (optional)</li>
        

        </ul>
    
    <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make Mascarpone Cream:</strong> In a bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until thick and pale. Gently fold in mascarpone until smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Whip Cream:</strong> In another bowl, whip heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Coffee Soak:</strong> In a shallow dish, mix espresso and coffee liqueur if using. Dip each ladyfinger briefly into the coffee mixture, careful not to over-soak.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer Tiramisu</strong> In an 8x8-inch dish, arrange a layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat layers with remaining ladyfingers and mascarpone</li>
            <li><strong>Chill:</strong>  Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>  Dust with cocoa powder before serving. Top with chocolate shavings if desired.</li>
           
        </ol>
